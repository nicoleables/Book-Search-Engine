# Book-Search-Engine

## Description
This project involves refactoring a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The application is built using the MERN stack, featuring a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Users can search for books and save their searches to the back end.
